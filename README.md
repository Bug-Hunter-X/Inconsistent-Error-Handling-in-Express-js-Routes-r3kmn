# Inconsistent Error Handling in Express.js Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inconsistent error handling across different routes.  The `/users/:id` route correctly handles the case where a user is not found, returning a 404 status code. However, the `/users` route lacks comprehensive error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if database operations fail.

**Bug:** The `/users` route does not handle errors from database operations appropriately.  An error during data retrieval results in a server-side error without a proper client-side response, potentially leading to unexpected behavior for the user.

**Solution:** Implement consistent error handling in all routes to gracefully handle database errors and provide appropriate responses to clients. This should include logging of errors to aid debugging and returning suitable HTTP status codes to inform the client of the issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `node bug.js`
4. Test the `/users/:id` route (it will work correctly).
5. Test the `/users` route (it will likely crash or behave erratically if a database error occurs).
